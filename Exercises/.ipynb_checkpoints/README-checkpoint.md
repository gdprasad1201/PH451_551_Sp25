The python refreshers will be individual submissions submitted as a pdf file to blackboard. 

For later assignments, you will be assigned to a group and should work and submit as a group.
Each group should submit a single copy of each exercise solution as a pdf file to blackboard unless otherwise specified. 
Sometimes we may ask for additional content such as saved model files, etc.
Groups should alternate who submits each week. 
The group assignments are meant to be collaborative so everybody should contribute each week.
